    <p>
      <span class="large-pronoun">he/him</span> is a pretty close, and very
      convenient, approximation to how I feel about myself, gender-wise.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am fine with being referred to by
      <span class="gender">any pronouns</span>. If you ask me what to call me, I
      will always say he/him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nouns I am pickier about. I prefer
      <span class="gender">neutral or masculine nouns</span>, except the word
      <span class="noun">man</span>. A <span class="noun">man</span> is a lot of
      things that I am not and do not wish to be.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="noun">Men</span>, plural, is a common and practical term for
      a group of male-presenting individuals. In this sense, I am okay with
      being included in a group of <span class="noun">men</span>; I simply would
      rather not be singled out as a <span class="noun">man</span>.
